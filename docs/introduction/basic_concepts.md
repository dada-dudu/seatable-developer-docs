## Data model

as developer you must interact typically with one single base. In SeaTable, a base includes multiple tables, and a table contains multiple rows and columns. A row contains multiple fields.

look at the api reference. (dort muss noch column xyz aufgenommen werden)

## Authentication

Script directly interact with the data of a base. no visual output. 

plugins deal always with the data of one base. 
plugins are great to visualisize and interact with data. the development of a seatable plugin requires more skills and ...

if you want to build your own application you always have to authenticate with a base token against the base. 

## Multiple bases

theoretically possible with an api-request but we recommend to avoid this in any case. use functions like common datasets inside seatable to get all relevant data into one base.
