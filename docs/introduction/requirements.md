# Requirements

Your decision is made: you want to develop your own script, your own plugin or your custom application. That is a great decision and I promise you that this guile will get you covered. If you are a professional developer some descriptions might seem obvious to your. Please excuse, this manual should also help beginning developers who do not yet have that much experience.

## Development system

First of all you will need a SeaTable System to make your first steps with the development with and for SeaTable. If you just want to write some short scripts, [SeaTable Cloud](https://seatable.io/preise/?lang=auto) might be the right choice for you. But as soon as your development gets deeper or you want to build your own plugins, I highly recommend to you that you create your own SeaTable Server.
Check out [admin manual](https://admin.seatable.io) how to install one.

## Programming skills

Depending of what you want to develop you will require different development skills. The following will show you which you will require.

=== "Scripts"

    Scripts inside SeaTable can only be written with either Javascript or Python. Therefore you will only require one of these programming languages.

=== "Plugins"

    The development of a custom plugin for your own SeaTable Server requires profound knowlegde of Javascript and react.

    Even if the `SeaTable plugin templates` offers some reusable components, you will need some experience with react to build the interface of your plugin.

=== "Client API's"

    Due to the publicly available and well documented API documentation, you can theoretically interact with SeaTable using any programming language.

## Learn the fundamentals

If you don't have enough experience the following general tutorials might help you to build the foundation to start developing for seatable.

There are countless free online tutorials for various programming languages to be found on the Internet. However, in our experience, it is advisable to spend a few euros to buy a consistent online course or a book on the respective topic.
